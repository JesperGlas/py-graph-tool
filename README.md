# py-graph-tool
A visual graph tool in Python. The goal is to be able to draw graphs and export them as data structures for other projects. It uses the dearpygui for graphics.

## Features (TODO)
- Ability to place/remove vertices on a 2D plance.
- Ability to connect vertices to create edges in the graph.
- Ability to customize weights of the edges.
